  <h1>My Mainframe</h1>
  <p>Yea i have a main frame its the size of a car it also draws 20,000W of power at idle. I use the Mainframe for
    watching cartoons on the family tv. I would say having a Mainframeis soo gamechanging becuse of its power to show 10
    shows at once!</p>

  <h1>My Super Cool Plane</h1>
  <p>A while back I worked on a small project you might have heard of... China's H20 stealth bomber. I personal played a
    part in the design of the oil check window light. I worked on this unknowingly during my time at <a
      href="https://wish.com">wish.com</a>. So this basicly makes me a plane creator guy a person who suplys the
    goverment with big-boy guns.</p>
